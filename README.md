# Basic Search Engine - Java Project

This repository contains my learning project from the [**Amazon Junior Software Developer**](https://www.coursera.org/programs/eightfold-pliic/professional-certificates/amazon-junior-software-developer) certification courses on Coursera. This project demonstrates my ability to apply file I/O, sorting and searching algorithms, user interaction, logging, and serialization to build a functional search application.

## Course

This project is based on the following Coursera course:

- [**Data Structures and Algorithms**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developer-data-structures-and-algorithms/)

---

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a basic search engine application that can:

- Read and parse data from files to populate objects
- Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort) to organize data based on user-selected criteria
- Provide a text-based menu system for user interaction
- Log and save user activity for analysis and debugging
- Serialize and deserialize data to maintain persistence between program runs

---

## What I Learned

- How to efficiently read data from files and convert it into usable program objects
- Implementation of classic sorting algorithms and their integration into an application
- Developing flexible search functionality with case-insensitive queries
- Designing interactive console menus for enhanced user experience
- Logging user interactions for better program monitoring
- Applying serialization techniques to save and restore application state

---

## Notes

- IDE-specific files (`.iml`, `.idea`) and build outputs are excluded from version control and should be configured locally.
- Familiarity with Java programming and standard project setup is assumed.

---

## Usage

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE and run the main class to start the application.
